<h1>Sudoku</h1>
<p>originally called Number Place),[1] is a logic-based,[2][3] combinatorial[4] number-placement puzzle.
  The objective is to fill a 9�9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3�3
  subgrids that compose the grid (also called "boxes", "blocks", "regions", or "subsquares") contains all of the
  digits from 1 to 9.
  The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid, which for a well-posed puzzle has a unique solution.</p>
